# Brain-Tumour-Classification
This was project was done with 3 other groups members for an AI module at I was taking at NUS. Given images of brain tumours labelled as malignant or benign and our task was to evaluate different classical machine learning and deep learning models in classifying the images of the tumours. You may wish to read our report on how we handled he data and evaluated our models, titled 'Report' in this repository. 

Here are some steps on how to run the code (titled 'Code' in this repository) if you wish to do so:
  1. Download and upload the 'Code' file into your google drive before running. This is because we used Google Colab to type up our code so that we could all work on it simultaneously.
  2. Download the zip file labelled 'Brain Tumour' and upload this to yoru google drive as itself and not under any sub-folders. This means the directory of the data folder inside the Brain Tumor folder should be: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Brain Tumor/data`
  3. Please ensure that the code is run sequentially (i.e. starting from the first section “Importing relevant libraries”). Please do not skip any sections while running the code.
